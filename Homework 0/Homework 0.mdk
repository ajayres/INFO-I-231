# Basic Text Typewriting

Here is a list:

* item 1
* item 2
* item 3
* subscripting: ~XXX~; superscripting: ^XXX^

This is a XXX. Newly introduced notion will be emphasized in italic font such as *XXX*. We could also add boldface to it, e.g., **XXX**.

Mathematics can be inlined like $ XXX $. Or, they can be elegantly presented in standalone blocks like below:
~ Equation { #euler-thm }
XXX
~

The above theorm can be referenced as Equation 
~ Equation { #eqn-label } 
XXX 
~ 

We may prove it as a theorm:

~ Theorm {#th-euler; caption:"Euler's theorem" }
XXX
~

# Basics of typesetting code

Below is a Javascript program snippe
``` javascript
function hello() {
  return "hello world!"
}
```

Here is the Jave code we mentioned in the first lecture:
``` javascript
int total = 0;
  for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++)
    total = total + i;
```
And typing up Haskell is as easy:
``` haskell
sum [1...10]
```

~ Note
The syntax highlighting works in the PDF output too.

## First feature I liked was headings and rules; for instance,

#### Of Headings  You Can Write
##### By Just Adding More Pound Signs
###### Before The Sentence...Up To Six Pound Signs

## The second feature I liked was Block Quotes

By just adding a right arrow (>) before each line you can make a block quote.
